Description:   Protects simply your web directories with a web based
               front end. Highly configureable.

Required server settings
------------------------
Apache: Set "AllowOverride AuthConfig" directive for target directory
        (see also http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/htaccess.html)
PHP:    Write access to target directory.
-> ask your webspace provider for details!

Install
-------
Simply put htprotector.php to the target directory.
See other examples below under "Examples"

Customization
-------------
Please note the defines in htprotector.php. You can edit them to change the
appearance of various texts (eg. translate it to another language).
But please be honest to yourself: if you have no clue at all what
"defines", "strings", etc are: don't change anything. You may break
this script.

Support
-------
If you need any support, contact me (see eMail above). Any bug hints,
contributions ans suggestions are welcome.
I'm also offering commercial support, so don't hesitate if you require
special conditions and versions.

Examples
--------
HTprotector is designed to work out of the box, without any configuration
or knowlege of the techniques.
If you need to, it can be your authentication swiss army knife. See those
examples just as _some_ examples. It's not covering all the features
available.
Example 1: Playground
Let's assume you're a web designer and your home web server is also
accessible via Internet. New layouts for your customer web site are
located in a special web folder, which is protected by HTprotector.
The World should need a password, you don't.
So replace the HTACCESS_CONTENT define with the following line:
define ( "HTACCESS_CONTENT", "AuthName \"".HTTITLE."\"\nAllow from 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0\nAuthType Basic\nAuthUserFile ".HTPASSWD."\nRequire valid-user\n" );
Then the access from your local subnet 192.168.1.0 is granted to
access the folder without any password and all other need to
authenticate.
Example 2: Integrate in existing pages
You don't want just fit the layout to your web pages- you want to integrate
it seamless into your application. Perfect, use the HTP_HTML_INTRO and
HTP_HTML_EXTRO defines! Point these to files which contain the layout and
only the essential contents are displayed. Or include HTprotector from your
scripts and point the defines to empty files, than you have the full control
on your layout.
